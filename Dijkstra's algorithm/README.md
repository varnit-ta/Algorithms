Dijkstra's algorithm is another popular pathfinding algorithm used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, but it works slightly differently from A*. Instead of considering both the cost to reach a node and an estimate of the cost to reach the goal, Dijkstra's algorithm only considers the cost to reach each node from the starting node. Here's how it works:

### Working of Dijkstra's Algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the initial node and add it to the priority queue or set the distance to it as 0.
   - Set the distance to all other nodes to infinity or a very large number.
   - Set all nodes as unvisited.

2. **Loop**:
   - While there are still unvisited nodes:
     - Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the starting node. This is the current node.
     - Mark the current node as visited.
     - For the current node, consider all of its neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.
     - If the tentative distance to a neighbor is less than its current distance, update the neighbor's distance.

3. **Termination**:
   - If the destination node has been marked visited (when its shortest distance is known), or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity, then stop. The algorithm has finished.

### Algorithm:
```
function Dijkstra(start)
    initialize distances to all nodes as infinity, except start node (0)
    create an empty priority queue Q
    add start node to Q with distance 0
    while Q is not empty
        current := node in Q with the smallest distance
        remove current from Q
        for each neighbor of current
            calculate tentative_distance = distance from start to current + distance from current to neighbor
            if tentative_distance < distance to neighbor
                update distance to neighbor with tentative_distance
                add neighbor to Q
    return distances
```

### Key Components:
- **Distance**: The total cost of the shortest path from the start node to a particular node.
- **Priority Queue**: Used to select the node with the smallest distance efficiently.
- **Visited Set**: Keeps track of nodes that have been visited.
- **Neighbors**: The adjacent nodes to the current node being considered.

Dijkstra's algorithm guarantees finding the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph, provided that there are no negative edge weights. However, it can be slower than A* in some scenarios, especially when an efficient heuristic is available for guiding the search towards the goal.
